Actions are a way of structuring your business logic in Laravel.
This package adds easy support to make them queueable.

```php
$myAction->onQueue()->execute();
```

You can specify a queue name.

```php
$myAction->onQueue('my-favorite-queue')->execute();
```

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-queueable-action
```

You can optionally publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\QueueableAction\QueueableActionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * The job class that will be dispatched.
     * If you would like to change it and use your own job class,
     * it must extends the \Spatie\QueueableAction\ActionJob class.
     */
    'job_class' => \Spatie\QueueableAction\ActionJob::class,
];
```

## Usage

If you want to know about the reasoning behind actions and their asynchronous usage,
you should read the dedicated blog post: [https://stitcher.io/blog/laravel-queueable-actions](https://stitcher.io/blog/laravel-queueable-actions).

You can use the following Artisan command to generate queueable and synchronous action classes on the fly.

```
php artisan make:action MyAction [--sync]
```

Here's an example of queueable actions in use:

``` php
class MyAction
{
    use QueueableAction;

    public function __construct(
        OtherAction $otherAction,
        ServiceFromTheContainer $service
    ) {
        // Constructor arguments can come from the container.

        $this->otherAction = $otherAction;
        $this->service = $service;
    }

    public function execute(
        MyModel $model,
        RequestData $requestData
    ) {
        // The business logic goes here, this can be executed in an async job.
    }
}
```

```php
class MyController
{
    public function store(
        MyRequest $request,
        MyModel $model,
        MyAction $action
    ) {
        $requestData = RequestData::fromRequest($myRequest);

        // Execute the action on the queue:
        $action->onQueue()->execute($model, $requestData);

        // Or right now:
        $action->execute($model, $requestData);
    }
}
```

The package also supports actions using the `__invoke()` method. This will be detected automatically. Here is an example:

``` php
class MyInvokeableAction
{
    use QueueableAction;

    public function __invoke(
        MyModel $model,
        RequestData $requestData
    ) {
        // The business logic goes here, this can be executed in an async job.
    }
}
```

The actions using the `__invoke()` method should be added to the queue the same way as explained in the examples above, by running the `execute()` method after the `onQueue()` method.

```php
$myInvokeableAction->onQueue()->execute($model, $requestData);
```

### Testing queued actions

The package provides some test assertions in the `Spatie\QueueableAction\Testing\QueueableActionFake` class. You can use them in a PhpUnit test like this:

```php

/** @test */
public function it_queues_an_action()
{
    Queue::fake();

    (new DoSomethingAction)->onQueue()->execute();

    QueueableActionFake::assertPushed(DoSomethingAction::class);
}
```

Don't forget to use `Queue::fake()` to mock Laravel's queues before using the `QueueableActionFake` assertions.

The following assertions are available:

```php
QueueableActionFake::assertPushed(string $actionClass);
QueueableActionFake::assertPushedTimes(string $actionClass, int $times = 1);
QueueableActionFake::assertNotPushed(string $actionClass);
QueueableActionFake::assertPushedWithChain(string $actionClass, array $expextedActionChain = [])
QueueableActionFake::assertPushedWithoutChain(string $actionClass)
```

Feel free to send a PR if you feel any of the other `QueueFake` assertions are missing.

### Chaining actions

You can chain actions by wrapping them in the `ActionJob`.

Here's an example of two actions with the same arguments:

```php
use Spatie\QueueableAction\ActionJob;

$args = [$userId, $data];

app(MyAction::class)
    ->onQueue()
    ->execute(...$args)
    ->chain([
        new ActionJob(AnotherAction::class, $args),
    ]);
```

The `ActionJob` takes the action class *or* instance as the first argument followed by an array of the action's own arguments.

### Custom Tags

If you want to change what tags show up in Horizon for your custom actions you can override the `tags()` function.

``` php
class CustomTagsAction
{
    use QueueableAction;

    // ...

    public function tags() {
        return ['action', 'custom_tags'];
    }
}
```

### Job Middleware

Middleware where action job passes through can be added by overriding the `middleware()` function.

``` php
class CustomTagsAction
{
    use QueueableAction;

    // ...

    public function middleware() {
        return [new RateLimited()];
    }
}
```

### Action Backoff

If you would like to configure how many seconds Laravel should wait before retrying an action that has encountered
an exception on a per-action basis, you may do so by defining a backoff property on your action class:

``` php
class BackoffAction
{
    use QueueableAction;
    
    /**
     * The number of seconds to wait before retrying the action.
     *
     * @var array<int>|int
     */
    public $backoff = 3;
}
```

If you require more complex logic for determining the action's backoff time, you may define a backoff method on your action class:

``` php
class BackoffAction
{
    use QueueableAction;
    
    /**
     * Calculate the number of seconds to wait before retrying the action.
     *
     */
    public function backoff(): int
    {
        return 3;
    }
}
```

You may easily configure "exponential" backoffs by returning an array of backoff values from the backoff method.
In this example, the retry delay will be 1 second for the first retry, 5 seconds for the second retry, and 10 seconds for the third retry:

``` php
class BackoffAction
{
    /**
     * Calculate the number of seconds to wait before retrying the action.
     *
     */
    public function backoff(): array
    {
        return [1, 5, 10];
    }
}
```

### What is the difference between actions and jobs?

In short: constructor injection allows for much more flexibility.

### Testing the package
